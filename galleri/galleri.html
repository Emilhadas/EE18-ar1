              <p class="bildtext">Searchlights penetrate the darkness surrounding Apollo 8 on Pad 39-A at Kennedy Space Center. This mission was the first manned flight using the Saturn V. The towering 363-foot Saturn V was a multi-stage, multi-engine launch vehicle standing taller than the Statue of Liberty. Altogether, the Saturn V engines produced as much power as 85 Hoover Dams.</p>

                  Eimmart A, at 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) wide, is not large as lunar impact craters go, but its youth and location combine to make it spectacular. Because it is young — excavated by an asteroid or comet impact in the late Copernican, probably less than 100 million years ago — its rim is sharp, its impact melt flows and ponds are obvious, and the boulders strewn over the surface around it are prominent.</p>

              <p class="bildtext texthöger">When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the Moon during Apollo 11 in July 1969, he radioed to Earth that the landscape around him had "a stark beauty all its own." The whole Moon is like that. As proof, we offer this bright, young ray impact crater blasted in the eroded wall of the partly buried crater Hedin. It is distant from the starkly beautiful landscape Armstrong saw: the Apollo 11 landing site on Mare Tranquillitatis is more than 1000 kilometers to the east.</p>

              <p class="bildtext texthöger">Moore F is a 15-mile (24-kilometer) wide impact crater on the far side of the Moon with signs both of fiery youth and slow aging. One estimate places the crater age at 40 million years – that is young as lunar craters go.

                  The central elevated landform is at center right, but what really grabs scientists' attention are the impressive wall collapse features that bury the cracked impact melt in the western and southern parts of the crater. Tongues of debris extend northeast and east toward the crater center. Could the central elevated landform and wall collapses be related?</p>
